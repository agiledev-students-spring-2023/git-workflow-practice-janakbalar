## Response to article

AI has advanced significantly in recent years, with the latest improvement coming with the release of the chatbot ChatGPT, which is able to produce essays, write code, and more. The chatbot was released by a company called Open AI at the end of November and became a viral sensation very quickly. It garnered millions of users within months, growing at a rate much greater far surpassing other apps or sites. Despite having some problems with outages and no advertisers, Open AI has recently reached a $10 billion dollar deal with Microsoft. ChatGPT and the improvement of AI brings up an important issue about how it might be able to replace certain jobs or tasks that traditionally relied on people. AIâ€™s have been able to generate art and pictures that are almost indistinguishable from actual drawings or pictures taken. Similarly, it can answer questions and provide information about topics much faster than a person likely could. It is also able to write code and do computations very quickly. With the success of ChatGPT, many other companies are trying to follow suit and release their own AI-driven tools. Google is developing AI tools currently to come out soon. Baidu, a Chinese tech company, is developing its own chatbot as well. AI seems to be the future of tech and I am excited to see how it will continue to develop and become more integrated in everyday life. 


## Christina Borao's Thoughts:

ChatGPT has revolutionized many aspects of everyday life. Additionally, ChatGPT has introduced open AI to the public on a large scale. When revolutionary items are released to the many public niches of society, they need to adjust to the new product. The article states that New York City schools have banned ChatGPT. This is an ineffective approach, as schools cannot determine if a student used ChatGPT on their homework or in the privacy of their own home. With open AI in everyone's mind, open AI tools will become the standard for creating work more effectively.
